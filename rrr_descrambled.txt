 nantucket  nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket  nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they dont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear juicksand shoes something like laplander snow shoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois  look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket the poor little indians skeleton  what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and juohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults  and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conjuered the watery world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terrajueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales
